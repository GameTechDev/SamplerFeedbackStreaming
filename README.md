# Sampler Feedback Streaming

This repository contains a demo of `DirectX12 Sampler Feedback Streaming`, a technique using [DirectX12 Sampler Feedback](https://microsoft.github.io/DirectX-Specs/d3d/SamplerFeedback.html) to guide continuous loading and eviction of reserved resource tiles. Sampler Feedback Streaming allows scenes containing 100s of gigabytes of resources to be drawn on GPUs containing much less physical memory. The scene below uses just ~200MB of a 1GB heap, despite over 350GB of total texture resources.

The demo requires **`Windows 10 20H1 (aka May 2020 Update, build 19041)`** or later and a GPU with Sampler Feedback Support.

Sampler Feedback is supported in hardware on Intel Iris Xe Graphics, as can be found in 11th Generation Intel&reg; Core&trade; processors and discrete GPUs. This sample requires driver version ***[30.0.100.9667](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) or later***.

## Requirements

The demo requires **`Windows 10 20H1 (aka May 2020 Update, build 19041)`** or later and a GPU with Sampler Feedback Support.

Intel Iris Xe Graphics, as can be found in 11th Generation Intel&reg; Core&trade; processors and future discrete GPUs, requires BETA driver [30.0.100.9667](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) or later.

Note this repository does not contain the textures shown above, which total over 13GB. A link to these textures will hopefully be provided soon. Test textures are provided, as is a mechanism to convert from BCx format DDS files into the custom .XET format. UPDATE: The first "release" package (labeled "1") contains a .zip with a few hi-res textures.

This repository will be updated when DirectStorage for Windows&reg; becomes available.

## Build Instructions

Download the source. Build the solution file with Visual Studio 2019.

## Running

All executables and .bat files will be found in the x64/Release or x64/Debug directories.

To run within Visual Studio, change the working directory to $(TargetDir) under Properties/Debugging:

![set working directory to $(TargetDir)](./readme-images/project-settings.png "set Working Directory to \$(TargetDir)")

By default (no command line options) the application starts looking at a single object, "terrain", which allows for exploring sampler feedback streaming. In the top right find 2 windows: on the left is the raw GPU min mip feedback, on the right is the min mip map generated by the application. Across the bottom are the mips of the texture, with mip 0 in the bottom left. Left-click drag the terrain to see sampler feedback streaming in action.

    c:\SamplerFeedbackStreaming\x64\Release> expanse.exe

![default startup](./readme-images/default-startup.jpg "default startup")

The batch file `demo.bat` starts in a more interesting state. Note keyboard controls are inactive while `Camera` animation is non-zero.

    c:\SamplerFeedbackStreaming\x64\Release> demo.bat

![demo batch file](./readme-images/demo-bat.jpg "demo.bat")

The textures in the first "release" package, hubble-16k.zip, work with "demo-hubble.bat". Make sure the mediadir in the batch file is set properly, or override it on the command line as follows:

    c:\SamplerFeedbackStreaming\x64\Release> demo-hubble.bat -mediadir c:\hubble-16k

## Configurations

By default, the application loads `config.json`.

However, it has been observed that performance decays over time on earlier nvidia devices/drivers (as the tiles in the heap become fragmented relative to resources). Specifically, the CPU time for [UpdateTileMappings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12commandqueue-updatetilemappings) limits the system throughput.

If you observe this issue (most obvious with stress.bat using large textures), run the included batch files with the addition of `-config nvidia.json`, which distributes resources across many small heaps. E.g.:

    c:\SamplerFeedbackStreaming\x64\Release> demo.bat -config nvidia.json
    c:\SamplerFeedbackStreaming\x64\Release> stress.bat -mediadir c:\hubble-16k -config nvidia.json

## Keyboard controls

There are a lot of keyboard controls - a function of giving many demos:

* `qwe / asd` : strafe left, forward, strafe right / rotate left, back, rotate right
* `z c` : levitate up and down
* `x` : toggles "up lock". When hovering over the "terrain" object, locking the up direction "feels right" with mouse navigation. Otherwise, it should be turned off.
* `v b` : rotate around the look direction (z axis)
* `arrow keys` : rotate left/right, pitch down/up
* `shift` : move faster
* `mouse left-click drag` : rotate view
* `page up` : toggle the min mip map viewer for the "terrain" geometry in the center of the universe
* `page down` : while camera animation is non-zero, toggles fly-through "rollercoaster" vs. fly-around "orbit"
* `space` : toggles camera animation on/off.
* `home` : toggles UI. Hold "shift" while UI is enabled to toggle mini UI mode.
* `end` : toggle overlay of min mip map onto every object
* `insert` : toggles frustum. This behaves a little wonky.
* `esc` : while windowed, exit. while full-screen, return to windowed mode

## JSON configuration files and command lines

For a full list of command line options, pass the command line "?"

Most of the detailed controls for the system can be find in a *json* file. The options in the json have corresponding command lines, e.g.:

json:

    "mediaDir" : "media"

command line:

    -mediadir c:\myMedia

## Creating Your Own Textures

The executable `DdsToXet.exe` converts BCn DDS textures to the custom XET format. Only BC1 and BC7 textures have been tested. Usage:

    c:> ddstoxet.xet -in myfile.dds -out myfile.xet

The batch file `convert.bat` will read all the DDS files in one directory and write XET files to a second directory. The output directory must exist.

    c:> convert c:\myDdsFiles c:\myXetFiles

## TileUpdateManager: a library for streaming textures

Within the source, there is a *TileUpdateManager* library that aspires to be stand-alone. The central object, *TileUpdateManager*, allows for the creation of streaming textures and heaps to contain them. These objects handle all the feedback resource creation, readback, processing, and file/IO.

## Known issues

The demo exhibits texture cracks due to the way feedback is used. Feedback is always read *after* drawing, resulting in loads and evictions corresponding to that frame only becoming available for a future frame. That means we never have exactly the texture data we need when we draw (unless no new data is needed). Most of the time this isn't perceptible, but sometimes a fast-moving object enters the view resulting in visible artifacts.

The following image shows an exaggerated version of the problem, created by disabling streaming completely then moving the camera:

![Streaming Cracks](./readme-images/streaming-cracks.jpg "Streaming Cracks")

In this case, the hardware sampler is reaching across tile boundaries to perform anisotropic sampling, but encounters tiles that are not physically mapped. D3D12 Reserved Resource tiles that are not physically mapped return black to the sampler. I believe this could be mitigated by "eroding" the min mip map such that there is no more than 1 mip level difference between neighboring tiles. That visual optimization is TBD.

There are also a few known bugs:
* entering full screen in a multi-gpu system moves the window to a monitor attached to the GPU by design. However, if the window starts on a different monitor, it "disappears" on the first maximization. Hit *escape* then maximize again, and it should work fine.
* full-screen while remote desktop is broken *again*. Will likely fix soon.
